	abstract = {Managed populations of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) support the production of a global food supply. This important role in modern agriculture has rendered honey bees vulnerable to the noxious effects of anthropogenic stressors such as pesticides. Although the deleterious outcomes of lethal pesticide exposure on honey bee health and performance are apparent, the ominous role of sublethal pesticide exposure is an emerging concern as well. Here, we use a data harvesting approach to better understand the toxicological effects of pesticide exposure across the honey bee life cycle. Through compiling adult- and larval-specific median lethal dose (LD50) values from 93 published data sources, LD50 estimates for insecticides, herbicides, acaricides, and fungicides are highly variable across studies, especially for herbicides and fungicides, which are underrepresented in the meta-data set. Alongside major discrepancies in these reported values, further examination of the compiled data suggested that LD50 may not be an ideal metric for honey bee risk assessment. We also discuss how sublethal effects of pesticide exposure, which are not typically measured in LD50 studies, can diminish honey bee reproduction, immunity, cognition, and overall physiological functioning, leading to suboptimal honey bee performance and population reduction. In consideration of actionable solutions to mitigate the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure, we have identified the potential for probiotic supplementation as a promising strategy that can be easily incorporated alongside current agricultural infrastructure and apicultural management practices. Probiotic supplementation is regularly employed in apiculture but the potential for evidence-based targeted approaches has not yet been fully explored within a formal toxicological context. We discuss the benefits, practical considerations, and limitations for the use and delivery of probiotics to hives. Ultimately, by subverting the sublethal effects of pesticides we can help improve the long-term survival of these critical pollinators.},

Agrochemical products and other classes of contaminants, such as trace elements and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, contribute to the general decline of bees’ populations. For this reason, effects, and particularly sublethal effects of contaminants need to be investigated. We conducted a review of the existing literature regarding the type of effects evaluated in Apis mellifera, collecting information about regions, methodological approaches, the type of contaminants, and honey bees’ life stages. Europe and North America are the regions in which A. mellifera biological responses were mostly studied and the most investigated compounds are insecticides. A. mellifera was studied more in the laboratory than in field conditions. Through the observation of the different responses examined, we found that there were several knowledge gaps that should be addressed, particularly within enzymatic and molecular responses, such as those regarding the immune system and genotoxicity. The importance of developing an integrated approach that combines responses at different levels, from molecular to organism and population, needs to be highlighted in order to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic contamination on this pollinator species.},

	abstract = {There is mounting evidence of pollinator decline all over the world and consequences in many agricultural areas could be significant. We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to €153 billion, which represented 9.5\% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between €190 and €310 billion based upon average price elasticities of − 1.5 to − 0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about €50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged €151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged €761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories – namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets.},

	doi = {10.1272/jnms.74.92},
	abstract = {Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are widely used throughout the world as insecticides in agriculture and as eradicating agents for termites around homes. The main toxicity of OPs is neurotoxicity, which is caused by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. OPs also affect the immune response, including effects on antibody production, interleukin-2 production, T cell proliferation, decrease of CD5 cells, and increases of CD26 cells and autoantibodies, Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles, and the inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activities. However, there have been few studies of the mechanism of OP-induced immunotoxicity, especially the mechanism of OP-induced inhibition of cytolytic activity of killer cells. This study reviews new mechanisms of OP-induced inhibition of the activities of NK cells, LAK cells, and CTLs. It has been reported that NK cells, LAK cells, and CTLs induce cell death in tumors or virus-infected target cells by two main mechanisms. The first mechanism is direct release of cytolytic granules that contain the pore-forming protein perforin, several serine proteases termed granzymes, and granulysin by exocytosis to kill target cells, which is called the granule exocytosis pathway. The second mechanism is mediated by the Fas ligand (Fas-L)/Fas pathway, in which FasL (CD95 L), a surface membrane ligand of the killer cell cross links with the target cell's surface death receptor Fas (CD95) to induce apoptosis of the target cells. To date, it has been reported that OPs inhibit NK cell, LAK cell, and CTL activities by at least the following three mechanisms: 1) OPs impair the granule exocytosis pathway of NK cells, LAK cells, and CTLs by inhibiting the activity of granzymes, and by decreasing the intracellular levels of perforin, granzyme A, and granulysin, which were mediated by inducing degranulation of NK cells and by inhibiting the transcription of the mRNAs of perforin, granzyme A, and granulysin. 2) OPs impair the FasL/Fas pathway of NK cells, LAK cells, and CTLs, as investigated by using perforin-knockout mice, in which the granule exocytosis pathway of NK cells does not function and only the FasL/Fas pathway remains functional. 3) OPs induce apoptosis of immune cells.},

In recent years the decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild and the collapse of honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops have a negative impact on bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined residues. Risks by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothrin and ergosterol inhibiting fungicides. More attention should be paid to specific residue mixtures that may result in synergistic toxicity to bees.},

	abstract = {Neonicotinoid insecticides have been signaled as an important driver of widespread declines in bee diversity and abundance. Neonicotinoids were registered in the 1990s and by 2010 accounted for one third of the global insecticide market. Following a moratorium in 2013, their use on open-field crops was completely banned in the EU in 2018. Pesticide regulation should be based on solid and updated scientific evidence, whereby products showing unacceptable effects on the environment are not approved. Clearly, pesticide regulation failed to detect the ecological threats posed by neonicotinoids. We argue that at the time neonicotinoids were authorized, risk assessment (RA) protocols were inadequate to detect some of the risks associated with neonicotinoid properties, including high efficacy, long persistence, high systemicity, high mobility, and application versatility. We advocate for the adoption of a more holistic RA approach that should account for: a) temporal and spatial dimensions of pesticide exposure; b) co-exposure to multiple compounds; c) differences among bee species with different life histories in levels of exposure and sensitivity; and d) sublethal effects (mostly ignored in current RA procedures). We also argue that regulatory studies conducted to support pesticide registration should be publicly available, and that pesticide regulation should not be discontinued once a product has been authorized. We should use the knowledge acquired through the neonicotinoid experience as an opportunity to profoundly revise bee RA schemes. These efforts should be initiated promptly; the neonicotinoid story has also taught us that the regulatory system is reluctant to react.},

	abstract = {With the advances in computational resources, there is an increasing urge among the computational researchers to make the in silico approaches fast, convenient, reproducible, acceptable, and sensible ones. Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligand–receptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand. Employing the abovementioned ligand- and structure-based methodologies and chemical libraries, virtual screening (VS) emerged as an important tool in the quest to develop novel drug compounds. VS serves as an efficient computational tool that integrates structural data with lead optimization as a cost-effective approach to drug discovery.},

	abstract = {The expansion of theoretical chemistry and molecular modeling analysis has been assisted by advanced computational platforms. Computers not only can be used to solve complex chemical equations, but also to provide a suitable graphical viewer package to hypothetically visualize simulated operations and their output. Hence, computer technology proves to be an indispensable tool for carrying out molecular modeling operations. In fact, one can easily run such a job using the default values specified by the provider of a specific program. In order to interpret the outcome of a molecular modeling operation, one needs to have sufficient knowledge of the theoretical bases of the operations involved. In this chapter, we have attempted to provide some basics of different aspects of computational chemistry, where computer applications are crucial. In addition, we have provided the basic theoretical foundation involved in such processes, on the assumption that readers are novices in this field. With a clear conception of the theoretical bases, one can not only interpret the results of such modeling operations, but also modify the process variables in accordance with the needs in question. While certain processes might give appreciable results for certain groups of chemicals under defined criteria, it may be the case that other processes may fail or not even be applicable. Hence, readers are advised to achieve a basic theoretical insight of the molecular modeling operations in the light of computational algorithms instead of considering them a “black-box tool” for obtaining data.},

	abstract = {The interface of any given ligand and protein—normally considered a macromolecule—of a known or predicted/modeled structure can be computed by determining each potential ligand position, resulting in an array of possibilities which are finally expressed in numerical energy values based on their thermodynamic affinity. Over the past few decades, this premier approach technique has proved to be crucial as an automated method in drug design and discovery, as well as in other fields. Data are retrieved from contour surface calculations for each ligand probe and can be analyzed to delineate regions of attraction on the basis of energy levels. Negative energy levels from contours are used to infer protein-ligand affinity clefts and are therefore relevant to drug design. Accordingly, molecular docking, framed as the “new microscope,” is part of a group of in silico computational techniques that enable the behavior of molecular chemistry to be analyzed and predicted in an inexpensive manner. From the starting point of framing the key terms in the binomial macromolecule-ligand docking approach, this chapter presents an introductory description of the progress made in this field of research over the past several years, in addition to present and future perspectives. This chapter presents a broad plethora of possibilities arising from the old docking alternatives to the current software technology and critically dissects and discusses the emerging trends. Despite the emergence of more degrees of freedom, a number of flexible conglomerates have not been well developed, and there are still computational limitations to solve, including several features in the focused technique. The present goals, such as molecular flexibility, binding entropy, and the presence of ions and solute conditions, are revisited with the purpose of anticipating the challenges, goals, and achievements in this field over the next few years or decades.},

Scoring functions are a vital piece of any molecular docking pipeline as they determine the fitness of sampled poses. Here we describe and evaluate the 1.0 release of the Gnina docking software, which utilizes an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a scoring function. We also explore an array of parameter values for Gnina 1.0 to optimize docking performance and computational cost. Docking performance, as evaluated by the percentage of targets where the top pose is better than 2Å root mean square deviation (Top1), is compared to AutoDock Vina scoring when utilizing explicitly defined binding pockets or whole protein docking. GNINA, utilizing a CNN scoring function to rescore the output poses, outperforms AutoDock Vina scoring on redocking and cross-docking tasks when the binding pocket is defined (Top1 increases from 58\% to 73\% and from 27\% to 37\%, respectively) and when the whole protein defines the binding pocket (Top1 increases from 31\% to 38\% and from 12\% to 16\%, respectively). The derived ensemble of CNNs generalizes to unseen proteins and ligands and produces scores that correlate well with the root mean square deviation to the known binding pose.

The goal is discovering high-quality leads in the initial stages of the development cycle, to minimize the costs associated with failures at later ones. Objective: Thus, there is a great amount of interest in further developing and optimizing high-throughput screening and in silico screening, the two methods responsible for generating most of the lead compounds. Although high-throughput screening is the predominant starting point for discovery programs, in silico methods have gradually made inroads by their more rational approach, to expedite the drug discovery and development process. Conclusion: Modern drug discovery strategies include both methods in tandem or in an iterative way. This review primarily provides a succinct overview and comparison of experimental and in silico screening techniques, selected case studies where both methods were used in concert to investigate their performance and complementary nature and a statement on the developments in experimental and in silico approaches in the near future.},

	abstract = {The need to develop new tools and increase capacity to test pharmaceuticals and other chemicals for potential adverse impacts on human health and the environment is an active area of development. Much of this activity was sparked by two reports from the US National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Sciences, Toxicity Testing in the Twenty-first Century: A Vision and a Strategy (2007) and Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment (2009), both of which advocated for “science-informed decision-making” in the field of human health risk assessment. The response to these challenges for a “paradigm shift” toward using new approach methodologies (NAMS) for safety assessment has resulted in an explosion of initiatives by numerous organizations, but, for the most part, these have been carried out independently and are not coordinated in any meaningful way. To help remedy this situation, a framework that presents a consistent set of criteria, universal across initiatives, to evaluate a NAM's fit-for-purpose was developed by a multi-stakeholder group of industry, academic, and regulatory experts. The goal of this framework is to support greater consistency across existing and future initiatives by providing a structure to collect relevant information to build confidence that will accelerate, facilitate and encourage development of new NAMs that can ultimately be used within the appropriate regulatory contexts. In addition, this framework provides a systematic approach to evaluate the currently-available NAMs and determine their suitability for potential regulatory application. This 3-step evaluation framework along with the demonstrated application with case studies, will help build confidence in the scientific understanding of these methods and their value for chemical assessment and regulatory decision-making.},

	abstract = {The US EPA has made great advances in the development of new approach methodologies (NAMs) for filling information gaps for decision-making and integrating those tools and data streams into chemical risk assessment. NAMs are commonly defined to include in silico approaches, in chemico and in vitro assays, as well as the inclusion of information from the exposure of chemicals in the context of hazard assessment. They may also include a variety of new testing tools, such as 'high-throughput screening' and 'high-content methods' e.g. genomics, proteomics, metabolomics; as well as some 'conventional' methods that aim to improve understanding of toxic effects, either through improving toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic knowledge for substances. 

The EPA has worked with other stakeholders to leverage resources and develop NAMs that can support different regulatory contexts. Building confidence in the use of NAMs for regulatory decision-making is key to the increased implementation of these methods. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the US EPA.

The ever-expanding amount of protein-ligand binding and structural data enables the use of deep machine learning techniques for protein-ligand scoring. We describe convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions that take as input a comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) representation of a protein-ligand interaction. A CNN scoring function automatically learns the key features of protein-ligand interactions that correlate with binding. We train and optimize our CNN scoring functions to discriminate between correct and incorrect binding poses and known binders and nonbinders. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms the AutoDock Vina scoring function when ranking poses both for pose prediction and virtual screening.},

Machine learning techniques can make use of the increasing amounts of structural data that are becoming publicly available. Convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions in particular have shown promise in pose selection and affinity prediction for protein-ligand complexes. Neural networks are known for being difficult to interpret. Understanding the decisions of a particular network can help tune parameters and training data to maximize performance. Visualization of neural networks helps decompose complex scoring functions into pictures that are more easily parsed by humans. Here we present three methods for visualizing how individual protein-ligand complexes are interpreted by 3D convolutional neural networks. We also present a visualization of the convolutional filters and their weights. We describe how the intuition provided by these visualizations aids in network design.},

	abstract = {Formation of protein-ligand complexes causes various changes in both the receptor and the ligand. This review focuses on changes in pK and protonation states of ionizable groups that accompany protein-ligand binding. Physical origins of these effects are outlined, followed by a brief overview of the computational methods to predict them and the associated corrections to receptor-ligand binding affinities. Statistical prevalence, magnitude, and spatial distribution of the pK and protonation state changes in protein-ligand binding are discussed in detail, based on both experimental and theoretical studies. While there is no doubt that these changes occur, they do not occur all the time; the estimated prevalence varies, both between individual complexes and by method. The changes occur not only in the immediate vicinity of the interface, but sometimes far away. When receptor-ligand binding is associated with protonation state change at particular pH, the binding becomes pH dependent: we review the interplay between sub-cellular characteristic pH and optimum pH of receptor-ligand binding. It is pointed out that there is a tendency for protonation state changes upon binding to be minimal at physiologically relevant pH for each complex (no net proton uptake/release), suggesting that native receptor-ligand interactions evolved to reduce the energy cost associated with ionization changes. As a result, previously reported statistical prevalence of these changes – typically computed at the same pH for all complexes – may be higher than what may be expected at optimum pH specific to each complex. We also discuss whether proper account of protonation state changes appears to improve practical docking and scoring outcomes relevant to structure-based drug design. An overview of some of the existing challenges in the field is provided in conclusion.},

Vinardo is based on Vina, and was trained through a novel approach, on state of the art datasets. We show that the traditional approach to train empirical scoring functions, using linear regression to optimize the correlation of predicted and experimental binding affinities, does not result in a function with optimal docking capabilities. On the other hand, a combination of scoring, minimization, and re-docking on carefully curated training datasets allowed us to develop a simplified scoring function with optimum docking performance. This article provides an overview of the development of the Vinardo scoring function, highlights its differences with Vina, and compares the performance of the two scoring functions in scoring, docking and virtual screening applications. Vinardo outperforms Vina in all tests performed, for all datasets analyzed. The Vinardo scoring function is available as an option within Smina, a fork of Vina, which is freely available under the GNU Public License v2.0 from http://smina.sf.net. Precompiled binaries, source code, documentation and a tutorial for using Smina to run the Vinardo scoring function are available at the same address.},
